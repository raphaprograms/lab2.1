What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

For me the ARIA attributes are the most tricky because they can still be used even with semantic HTML elements. Also, since this is only a form some ARIA elements were not neccessary. We also don't have any part of the code that dynamicly updates in this Scrimba "Final Challenge". I did what I thought made sense or could be useful to someone who may pick up the code where I left off.



How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

ARIA attributes make web content more accessible especiall for those who use screen readers. It also provides additional context and functionality for users with assitive technologies, especially when not using semantic HTML that has a lot of the functionality ARIA attributes prove built in. 



What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

I used command + shift + c to view the color contrast using DevTools' 'Lighthouse' built in accessibility auditing tool. That made it easy to check the contrast.
